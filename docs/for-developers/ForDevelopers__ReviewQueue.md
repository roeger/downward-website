# Review queue {#review_queue}

## Why a queue and how to use it? {#why_a_queue_and_how_to_use_it}

-   The queue is intended as a TODO list for Malte. We hope that it can
    be a useful tool for Malte to keep track of who wants want and to
    keep the waiting times reasonably fair.
-   Use the queue for code reviews, discussions and other Fast Downward
    things that Malte should work on.
-   As of now, the queue is intended to be used by the Basel AI group
    only. If you think this should be changed, please get in touch.
-   Add new items to the end of the queue. Usually, Malte will work from
    the front of the queue, but there may be reasons to promote/demote
    things.
-   There is no need to put *everything* into the queue. It is intended
    for things that you would ideally like to get done right now, but
    that are not terribly urgent.
-   The queue should be easy to use and useful for everyone involved. If
    it turns out that this is not the case, we should get rid of it
    again.
