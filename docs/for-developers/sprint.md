# Sprint

A Fast Downward sprint is a two weeks period in which we invest most of
our time in improving the planner and tackle larger work packages called
"stories".

## Statistics

We estimate the effort of a story using the fictional *Haslum* (HSM)
score. A *Person Day* (PD) represents the work one person accomplishes
per day.

### For next sprint

-   Consider a dedicated review/review reaction phase.
-   Add/update the definition of done in the backlog.

## Old "To Improve" Outcomes

### To Improve After 2024-Jan/Feb Sprint

-   Improve Daily:
    -   Try not to solve problems directly in the daily. Instead, find
        time and place to solve them.
    -   Stop discussions that run on for too long. Sprint monarch should
        moderate, others should have an option to signal a boring
        discussion.
    -   Keep the "What I did yesterday" part short if it is not
        relevant for a blocker
    -   separate "blockers" from "how much time do I have today and
        when".
    -   When deciding on meeting times, quickly repeat the goal of the
        meeting.
-   New concepts in last sprint:
    -   Grab bag of 1-point stories. Could try this again but it should
        be clearer how it is supposed to be used.
    -   Ranked-Choice Voting (with <https://www.rankedchoices.com>). Had
        upsides and downsides. The choice of whether to use it again is
        up to the sprint monarch.
-   Reduce pressure at the end of the sprint to finish all stories:
    -   dropping stories to focus more on others is good but finishing
        stories under time pressure just to make the deadline should be
        avoided.
    -   Count Haslums partially for just the parts that were achieved?
    -   weekly meetings to finish stories outside of sprint?
-   Use meeting room for sprint planning, not the PhD office.

### To Improve After 2023-Sep Sprint

-   1 week sprint is good for many open stories. Otherwise prefer longer
    sprints.
-   Have more small tasks on the board, use (traffic light) magnet (also
    outside of the daily).
-   Make it easier to find a new point to enter.
-   Organize the daily by topic.

### To Improve After 2023-Jul Sprint

-   Work in pairs more often as a means to distribute knowledge.
-   When goals/stories are fuzzy, set a deadline for some subgoal.
    -   The negative example for this was learning about CMake.
    -   We could have for example said that we want to have a more
        concrete plan by day 2.
-   Consider defining time boxes for meetings.
    -   Maybe subdivide meeting into parts and ensure that there is an
        adequate amount of time to discuss each part.

### To Improve After 2023-Jan Sprint

-   Analyze grid performance
-   3 weeks are long since usually there are things left to do after the
    sprint, so effectively the sprint is almost a month long.
-   Towards the end of the sprint, meet to discuss on which stories we
    want to focus so we can finish them.
-   Every story has one person that is responsible for keeping it up to
    date (board & tracker).

### To Improve After 2022-Mar Sprint

-   daily meetings: go back to previous model where everyone says what
    they did and what they can do on that day, but go story by story
-   it could be helpful to always pull a story that has an easy entry
    barrier so that someone who has spare time can directly contribute
    (e.g., stories which require mainly mechanical work)

### To Improve After 2022-Jan Sprint

-   Daily Meetings: We will try to report the progress on a per story
    basis and the plan for the day on an individual basis.
-   As reviewer: Provide a time frame for your review (in consultation
    with the person for whom the review is).
-   Feel free to use @everyone to make announcements interesting for
    everyone.
-   If you are searching for new work, just ask in the Discord channels
    of stories which interest you.

### To Improve After 2021-Jun Sprint

-   We are not happy with our story voting rules. We want to try
    something new. Next time, one person becomes the product owner.
    He/She decides the focus of the sprint. The product owner prepares a
    set of well defined stories (with subtasks). The product owner does
    not need to know everything, but should consult the developers. It
    is his/her responsibility to create stories that motivate the sprint
    participants. At the sprint meeting, the developers will estimate
    the *Haslum* scores for each story and select a subset for the
    sprint.
-   We are not happy with the Jira board, but also do not know how to
    improve it. The board is useful to see on which tasks someone can
    help, but:
    -   Some stories have a linear structure. The board is not helpful
        for those.
    -   In a *physical* sprint with a physical board, it is easy to find
        a task and just ask someone in the room what to do for that
        task, in the virtual sprints with the virtual board, nobody is
        next to me who can help me start on that task.
-   Many stories have to be better defined.
