## Literature on Fast Downward as a whole

The following two papers describe the original version of Fast Downward
(~2003-2004) as a whole. They are still relevant to the current
implementation, but many parts have been added to the planner since then
(e.g. optimal planning, support for action costs, many more heuristics)
and many things described in the papers have been changed. The JAIR 2006
paper gives a complete account of the planner except for the translator
component. The AIJ 2009 paper describes the translator component.

## Literature on specific Fast Downward components

For specific components of Fast Downward, for example a particular
heuristic or search algorithms, we aim to give the most relevant
reference to the literature in the documentation of the component.
