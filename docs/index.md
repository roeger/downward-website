## Scientific experiments

We recommend to use the [latest release](https://github.com/aibasel/downward/releases/latest) instead of the tip of the main branch.
The [Downward Lab](https://lab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python package helps running Fast Downward experiments.
Our separate [benchmark repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks) contains a collection of planning tasks.
